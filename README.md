# Doctor-Prescripton-Handwritten-Recoginition
  This project uses handwriting recognition to recognize the names of medicines from a doctor's prescription. This is done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed using the Pytorch Framework and OpenCV.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Infi-09/Doctor-Prescripton-Handwritten-Recoginition.git
```
After downloading the repo, you have to download the datasets and models (for more info look into [data](data/) and [models](models/) folders).

### 2. Requirements
The project is created using Python 3.6 with Jupyter Notebook. I recommend using Anaconda. If you have it, you can run the installation as:
```
conda create --name ocr-env --file environment.yml
conda activate ocr-env
```
Main libraries (all required libraries are in [reqiurements.txt):
* numpy==1.17.2
* opencv-python==4.4.0.42
* pillow==6.1.0 
* scipy==1.5.2 
* torch==1.2.0

### Run
With all required libraries installed and cloned repo, run `jupyter notebook` in the directory of the project. Then you can work on the particular notebook.
